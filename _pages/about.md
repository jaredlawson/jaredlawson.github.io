I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Vanderbilt University. I work in the [Advanced Robotics and Mechanism Applications (ARMA) Lab]([http://arma.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/]) under [Dr. Nabil Simaan]([http://arma.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/index.php/people?id=75]). My dissertation research looks into enabling image and sensory-guided control of steerable robotic catheters for neurointervention. This work combines mechatronics, flexible rod modeling, fluoroscopic image segmentation, and control algorithms.

My first experiences with surgical robotics were as a undergraduate intern at [Medtronic]([https://www.medtronic.com/en-us/healthcare-professionals/specialties/surgical-robotics/robotic-assisted-surgery.html]), where I contributed first as a quality engineering intern on the surgeon console team before becoming a mechanical design intern on the surgical instrumentation team. After graduating from Boston University with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, I began working at [Neocis, Inc.]([https://www.neocis.com/]) as a mechanical engineer on the YOMI robot-assisted dental surgery platform. 

While I loved my work at both companies, I found myself wanting to contribute not only on mechanical design, but on all aspects of the robotic systems, including modeling and control software. This ultimately led to me to my current graduate studies at Vanderbilt with Dr. Simaan, and I am still today as eager to learn and innovate as when I first began!
